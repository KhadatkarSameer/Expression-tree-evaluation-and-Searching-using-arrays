Q1: Expression Evaluation using Trees and Stacks
---

You are given a mathematical expression as a string that is read from console input. The expression will be composed of four binary operators + - * / and non-negative integers as operands. Each sub-expression formed from a operator will be enclosed within parenthesis, i.e., (L op R) where L is the left operand, op is the operator and R is the right operand. There may be zero or more spaces between the operators, operands and parenthesis.

Q2: Searching using Arrays 
---

You are given a "numbers" input file with n+1 rows. The first line has a non-negative integer that indicates a count of the input numbers in the file 'n' and the remaining 'n' rows have an input integer each. Write C++ code to compactly insert these numbers into a binary tree implemented as an array.
